Main Details in Step 3
Access AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Log in with the AWS account credentials you created in Step 1.
Navigate to EC2 Service:

In the AWS Management Console, locate and click on the "Services" dropdown.
Under "Compute," click on "EC2" to access the EC2 Dashboard.
Launch an EC2 Instance:

On the EC2 Dashboard, click the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

In the "Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" step, select an AMI. For beginners, you can choose the "Amazon Linux 2 AMI" which is a common choice.
Choose an Instance Type:

In the "Choose an Instance Type" step, select an instance type. For this project, you can choose a general-purpose instance like "t2.micro," which is eligible for the Free Tier.
Configure Instance Details:

In the "Configure Instance Details" step:
Set the number of instances to 1.
You can leave other settings as default for this basic setup.
Add Storage:

In the "Add Storage" step, configure the storage settings for your instance.
You can leave the default settings for this basic setup.
Add Tags (Optional):

In the "Add Tags" step, you can add tags to your instance for better organization. Tags are key-value pairs.
Configure Security Group:

In the "Configure Security Group" step:
Create a new security group or use an existing one.
Open port 22 (SSH) to allow incoming connections for remote access.
Review Instance Launch:

Review your configuration in the "Review Instance Launch" step.
Ensure everything looks correct.
Create a Key Pair:

In the "Review Instance Launch" step, you'll need to create a key pair if you don't have one.
Choose "Create a new key pair," give it a name, and download the private key file (.pem).
Launch Instance:

After creating the key pair, click the "Launch" button.
A confirmation dialog will appear; select the key pair you just created and click "Launch Instances."
View Instances:

Go back to the EC2 Dashboard and click on "Instances" in the left navigation pane to view your running instance.

Step 4: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
Once the EC2 instance is running, connect to it using SSH.
Use the key pair you created during the instance launch.
Access your instance's public IP address.



Step 4: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
Access AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Log in with the AWS account credentials.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:

In the AWS Management Console, click on "Services" and then select "EC2" under "Compute."
View Running Instances:

In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Instances" in the left navigation pane to view your running instance.
Get Public IP Address:

Identify your running EC2 instance in the list.
Note the "IPv4 Public IP" address. This is the address you will use to connect to the instance.
Connect via SSH:

Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

Use the following SSH command to connect to your EC2 instance. Replace <your-key.pem> with the path to the private key file you downloaded during the instance launch, and <your-instance-ip> with the IPv4 Public IP address of your instance:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i <your-key.pem> ec2-user@<your-instance-ip>
Example:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i ~/Downloads/your-key.pem ec2-user@123.456.789.012
If you're using a Windows machine, you can use a tool like PuTTY to connect via SSH.


Confirm Connection:

You may be prompted to confirm the connection. Type "yes" and press Enter.
Connected to EC2 Instance:

You are now connected to your EC2 instance. You should see the command prompt of your instance.

Note: The user might vary based on the AMI you selected; for the "Amazon Linux 2 AMI," the default user is often "ec2-user."
